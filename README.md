 This is a project made on STS IDE in which Java Language is used as backend and for frontend HTML,CSS and Thymeleaf is used and MySql is used as Database.
 I have tried working on diffrent interlinked databses together.
 I have also integrated security using Spring security of Spring framework which makes this application free from any sort of data leak or data miss management.
 For frontend particularly i have tried using bootstrap templates using thymeleaf.
 I have also tested this particular application by running it through the inbuilt host provided by spring framework.


  Frontend:HTML,CSS,THYMELEAF and BOOTSTRAP.
  Database:MySql, Spring Data Jpa
  Backend:Java ,Spring framework
  Security:Spring Security
